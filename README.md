# PIDTest

  - Including scripts for testing the PID control logic in heating system

### test_flexHeat.py

 - This is the script to simulate PID output and manipulated inflow temperature based on initialized system status and a simplified thermal model to estimate indoor temperature. 
 
### test_flexHeat_sensor.py

 - This is the script to calculate PID output according to the real time sensor value ( with a random deviation to simulate temperature dynamics)
